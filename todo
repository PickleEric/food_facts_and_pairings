Is new menu structure ok?

User enters a food (e.g. "Tacos" or "Pizza") and app will fetch info about that food AND a beer AND a cocktail
User will have choice of saving all of this info as a group/collection of data 

Food API - decide what data this will return 
   - keep this simple - maybe a few pieces of data about a food 

Overall principle - something with fewer features but implemented well, designed well, and tested - is better

Database design - table or tables? 
Fill in db methods 

Tests - for APIs, database 

Code quality - spelling variable names, python code conventions 
Review modules, functions - S in SOLID

This is a program where the user can search a food that they want to eat for lunch, dinner or even breakfast!!!! The input the user types in one API will grab the nutritional info for that food item, the second API will talk to a cocktail database to grab a cocktail that would pair well with their food of choice, and the third API will suggest a wine or beer pairing with their food of choice if the user is not a fan of cocktails. 

Please download all the requirements in the requirements.txt file you can type in "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal and it will download all the requirments for this project
